# Heartphase: A cardiac coherence standard

[Heartphase](https://heartphase.com) takes a raw Lead I ECG (from an Apple Watch) then reconstructs a 3D phase space portrait and computes a coherence score, providing visual and numerical feedback about the degree of coherence between all heartbeats in the ECG.

#### Code

Heartphase 0.0.7 has five main files:

* `heartphase.py` ‚Äî Reconstructs a 3D phase space portrait and computes a coherence score.
* `animation.py` ‚Äî Animates the raw ECG and the 3D phase space portrait in synchrony.
* `fraction.py` ‚Äî Isolates and animates a selected heartbeat in the 3D phase space portrait.
* `selection.py` ‚Äî Simple tool for manual labelling of PQRST components in ECG.
* `variation.py` ‚Äî Computes the variance of all features (waveforms, segments and intervals) of all heartbeats.

As of Heartphase 0.0.3, Heartphase (`heartphase.py`) includes Conjugation, which time-reverses each segmented heartbeat and computes the coherence score for each time-reversed pair. These time-reversed coherence scores serve to confirm the coherence scores of the original heartbeats.

As of Heartphase 0.0.6, Fraction (`fraction.py`) only loads an ECG labelled using Selection (`selection.py`) in order to highlight the P-wave, QRS-complex and T-wave of a selected heartbeat.

The code is experimental and needs several improvements, e.g. more robust heartbeat segmentation and component detection. The two ECG samples (`ecg-sample.csv` and `ecg-sample.csv`) can be used to used to demo the code. As of Heartphase 0.0.5, `ecg-sample-pqrst.csv` is included as an example of an ECG labelled using `selection.py`.

To run the code, make sure you have installed the dependencies:

```
pip install numpy pandas scipy matplotlib tqdm
```
If you choose to use your own ECG, **remove** the following from the exported CSV to leave only the amplitude values (starting on row 1):
```
Name
Date of Birth,
Recorded Date,
Classification,
Symptoms,
Software Version,
Device,
Sample Rate,


Lead,Lead I
